# Dataprogramming
Project Assignment submission of data programming language in c for the following problems for the longest common subsequence and pattern matching.



$project
========
The programs are used for an assignment submisson when given two problems and the solution written in c prpgramming. The syntax and fucntion used are simple and easy to understand.
The article contributed GeeksforGeeks.com (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/) on the program of the first exercise and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regex-regular-expression-in-c/ for the second excercise.
Look how easy it is to use:

    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()

Features
--------

A subsequence is a sequence which appears in the same order but not necessarily contiguous. For example ACF, AFG, AFGHD, FGH are some subsequences of string ACFGHD. So for a string of length n there can be total 2^n subsequences. The LCS algorithm is widely used in bioinformatics.

Most string functions work with regular expressions, a concise language for describing patterns of text.
 For example, the regular expression "[ca*b]" matches the string in the other string using using an easy 
function called RegexMatch(char *S1, char* S2)  tells you if there’s any match to the pattern.

Installation
------------

Install $project by running:

    # Install the released version from open source, An online DBG compliler to run simple programs in C and  C++ 
    code. compile. run. debug. share.
    
  Using an online c compiler if a strong internet connection allows you to do so.https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
